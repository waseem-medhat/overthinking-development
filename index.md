This is my personal blog where I... *do what the title says.* My interests are in web development, functional programming, statistics, and data visualization.

## About Me

I'm Waseem! I write code at <https://github.com/waseem-medhat>

My education background was in pharmacy, but I always found myself more into
math and computers than the typical pharmaceutical sciences. I discovered that
I could combine by background and interests by starting a career in
biostatistics. So, I pursued that career and, after a period of self-learning,
managed to get a job. I have been working as a biostatistician and statistical
programmer for 5 years with R as my main tool.

Over time, I learned other data science tools like Python, SAS, SQL, and
Tableau, and after a while, I started learning about the web technologies
applied in data science and visualization fields. From there I've been ever
expanding my web development repertoire on both the front-end and the back-end
sides as well as DevOps.

The web ended up being a tool to empower my statistics career as well as a side
career of its own, and I'm looking forward to growing as a web developer!
