## Summary

Here is the part where I go all in on learning backend development! I started a subscription to Boot.dev which teaches Python and Go.

Also, my site is improving with project content and a Buy Me a Coffee link. What started as a little program to generate HTML turned into a full-fledged site, and I'm proud of that!

## Day 71 / Sep 30

* Started boot.dev which is a bootcamp-like platform for backend development - I started the first course which is an introduction to Python
    
* Made some adjustments to the blog to allow unfurling in social links but still needs some work
    

## Day 72 / Oct 1

* Completed the introductory Python course in Boot.dev
    

## Day 73 / Oct 2

* Started the next Boot.dev course which is about OOP. Not a huge OOP fan, but a refreshment is still nice.
    
* Followed some introductory tutorials in the official Go documentation website
    

## Day 74 / Oct 3

* Followed a tutorial in the official Go docs to connect a Go program to a SQL database
    
* Finished the OOP course in Boot.dev plus a little guided project on Boot.dev that aims to help set up a local development environment.
    

## Day 75 / Oct 4

* Started writing a blog article
    
* Started the next course in Boot.dev which teaches FP. Coming from Clojure, everything seems easy in that topic (not that the previous ones were hard)
    

## Day 76 / Oct 5

* Finished the FP course in Boot.dev and started the next one which teaches algorithms
    
* Started building a little CLI in Go - I really wanna focus on learning by building
    

## Day 77 / Oct 6

* Finished the algorithms course in Boot.dev and started the next one on data structures
    

## Day 78 / Oct 7

* Solved some exercises in the data structures course
    
* Set up a [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/wipdev) account
    
* Reorganized the blog and added the "Buy me a coffee" link
    

## Day 79 / Oct 8

* More data structures on Boot.dev
    

## Day 80 / Oct 9

* Also more data structures on Boot.dev, but it's getting harder and harder to progress now
