## Summary

There are some significant steps I took in these 10 days:

* Finished reading Clojure for the Brave and True (been a while since I got to read a book from start to finish)
    
* Switched to learning Go instead of Clojure
    
* Ported my blog to Hugo (still at [https://overthinking-development.blog/](https://overthinking-development.blog/))
    

I also published one post: [Developer Philosophies](/posts/developer-philosophies)

## Day 61 / Sep 20

* Read a little in chapter 12 in [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) which discusses Java interop.
    

## Day 62 / Sep 21

* Spent most of my time setting up Ubuntu and Emacs for better Clojure development in the future
    
* Did a new iteration for a previous problem I solved on Exercism after having a mentoring discussion
    

## Day 63 / Sep 22

* Fiddled with Emacs configuration for Clojure and got to set up CIDER which allows interactive development
    
* Finished chapter 12 of the book which ended with some examples of commonly used Java classes and the entirety of chapter 13 which is about extending Clojure with abstraction - with that, I reached the end of the book!
    

## Day 64 / Sep 23

* Started writing an article draft
    
* Added Paredit to my Emacs setup for structural editing
    
* Tried to solve a problem on Exercism but failed to complete it
    

## Day 65 / Sep 24

* Wrote more in the draft
    

## Day 66 / Sep 25

* Configured Emacs to work with Clojure LSP and display the errors and warnings in the buffer while editing
    
* Laid the foundation for a new backend project by copying some code I wrote before for experimentation
    

## Day 67 / Sep 26

* Started developing the project which is gonna be a simple API that does web scraping - I was able to pull a page and retrieve elements with CSS-style selectors
    

## Day 68 / Sep 27

* Completely unrelated to my drawn path, I started looking into Go for some reason. I found a condensed 1-hour video to get me started
    

## Day 69 / Sep 28

* I finished around 80-90% of the introductory Go video tutorial.
    
* Started a Hugo project to port my blog to a proper SSG. I copied the CSS and Markdown content and started adding some metadata.
    
* Started writing an article draft.
    

## Day 70 / Sep 29

* Adjusted the metadata and CSS for my Hugo blog and deployed it at [https://overthinking-development.blog/](https://overthinking-development.blog/). There is still some work to do.
    
* Published [Developer Philosophies](/posts/developer-philosophies)
