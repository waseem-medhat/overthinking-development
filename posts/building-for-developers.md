The idea of this article was inspired by a Backend Banter podcast episode with The Primeagen about CLI tools. I've been thinking about building a software product these days, but I didn't have a solid plan in mind to go about it. But this idea of building for developers may have narrowed down the possibilities for me.

So, I will discuss here some of my thoughts about the topic of building for developers based on what stuck with me from that podcast episode (plus some others that I'll refer to below).

An interesting expression for sure... I may have heard it before, but it stuck with me

If I am a developer, and I'm writing software for developers, then I can make software for myself. So, the first obvious win is that I can solve my own problems while building a product for the first time. The idea came from a podcast

As I've been listening to podcasts recently, it has been a recurrent theme that when building good software products, it's recommended that developers build products that solve their own problems. I think it makes sense because when I build something to use later, I will start getting a better idea about the strengths and weaknesses of the product, what features can be added, when it is appropriate to release it, etc. Another obvious advantage is that I solved a problem that I had.

However, while this is a good starting point, the natural extension of this is that other people should share my problem if that product is meant to be successful. In other words, the software I write should be not only helpful for me but for others as well. This means that you should "know your audience" because this is the only way you can help them with product
