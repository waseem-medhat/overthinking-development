## Reflection on the Whole Journey

What started with messing around with Clojure and blogging on Hashnode for fun
ended up with me making my first contributions to open-source, starting to
build real projects, and aspiring to be a back-end developer using Go. That was
both interesting and fun.

While I didn't end the challenge with a complete achievement like a finished
project or something, I am proud the most of getting a lot of clarity out of
this journey. I have been an aimless hobbyist for so many years, and I'm
grateful for all the skills I built over that time, but I always had the
feeling that I could do more with these skills but never acted on that feeling.
Now, I have a language that I am happy with and ready to learn at a deeper
level, and I have a goal to aim for!

So, I think that these 100 days were a success in terms of setting the stage
for what I'll be doing from now on to prepare myself for a back-end job.
Looking forward to the future!
